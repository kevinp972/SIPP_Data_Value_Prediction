In this project, I employed feature selection and flexible linear models to forecast the outcome variable, total wealth. For comprehensive project insights, kindly refer to "Predicting Total Wealth: A Predictive Analysis Using the 1991 SIPP Data.pdf."

The project encompasses a subset of the 1991 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), comprising 15 variables and 7933 observations.
