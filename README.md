In this project, I utilized feature selection and flexible linear models to predict the outcome variable, total wealth. For project details, please check "Predicting Total Wealth A Predictive Analysis Using the 1991 SIPP Data.pdf".

The project involves the 1991 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), which has 15 variables and 7933 observations.
