**Goal:** Improve the estimation accuracy of a person's total wealth and gain insights into how different features affect it, which is beneficial for businesses and policymakers alike.

**Total wealth (in US $):** "Net financial assets, including Individual Retirement Account (IRA) and 401(k) assets, plus housing equity, plus the value of business, property, and motor vehicles."

**Implemented flexible linear models, wrapper methods, L1 and L2 regularization, interaction term analysis, and hyperparameter 
tuning to predict total wealth, increasing estimation accuracy by improving Mean Squared Prediction Error (MSPE) by 2.3%.**

The project uses a subset of the 1991 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), comprising 15 variables and 7,933 observations.
